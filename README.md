<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<h4 style="font-weight:400;">I'm Zaid Rajab, I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science and I'm Flutter developer, nowadays I'm taking a course in full stack development since I can't find opportunities as Flutter developer.</h4>

<h2>What I learned from todays's lecutre?</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight:400;">I learned some primary commands in terminal, and how to deal with Git, I already know a big part of the lecture, but what really impressed me is the article that has been attached to the lab of the lecture, I learned from the article how important simpliciy is in software development, and to avoid predictions and assumptions.</h4>
